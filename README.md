Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding

This is a customer care chatbot including smart document understanding.Simple chatbot answers the queries of customers regarding certain product and if chatbot is able to answer some of them, it usually redirects user to a real agent who is a human. But we want to avoid human intervention and we want our chatbot to answer questions by its own. For this pupose we use Smart Documentation Understanding that means we feed user manual to watson discovery service and train watson assistant. In this way chatbot will be able to answer queries about that product.
